# Hulubricant

A simple Firefox extension to get rid of those pesky spoilers that appear right before 
the next episode of a series. It also converts all episode thumbnails to black to prevent
any possible spoilers from those as well.

A toggle for the extension may come in a future version. For now if you wish to block the 
features just disable the extension with FireFox.

## Insertion Query

The extension makes use of InsertionQuery. See https://github.com/naugtur/insertionQuery for
more information.
